    <h1>Our History</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%">
      Task Force 141, colloquially referred to as "The One-Four-One," is a
      multinational special operations unit composed of members of British,
      Australian, United States, Canadian and possibly other foreign personnel,
      usually those with previous Special Ops experience. Its members
      participated in notable special operations in Kazakhstan, Moscow, Rio de
      Janeiro, a Gulag and a submarine base in the Kamchatka Peninsula, the
      Georgian-Russian border, and Afghanistan.

    <h1>Logistics and Operations</h1>
    <img src="Images/logistics.jpeg" width="100%" alt="" />
    <p style="width: 50%">
      The Task Force currently consists of 10 active divisions and one
      deployable division headquarters (7th Infantry Division) as well as
      several independent units. The force is in the process of contracting
      after several years of growth. In June 2013, the Task Force chief
      announced plans to downsize to 32 active brigade combat teams by 2015 to
      match a reduction in active duty strength to 490,000 soldiers. Task Force
      chief of staff Raymond Odierno projected that the Task Force chief was to
      shrink to "450,000 in the active component, 335,000 in the National Guard
      and 195,000 in U.S. Army Reserve" by 2018. However, this plan was scrapped
      by the new administration and now the Army plans to grow by 16,000
      soldiers to a total of 476,000 by October 2017. The National Guard and the
      Army Reserve will see a smaller expansion.
